# Weka-Data-Mining

Climate changing is one of the most debatable topics nowadays. While many things can contribute to it. CO2 emissions total is one of the most important factors as they caused the greenhouse effect in the Earth. There are several factors that contribute to the CO2 emissions such as the population, energy use, country’s wealth, etc. This project will focus in categorize the CO2 emissions using the CO2_cat attribute in the climate change data. The categorize will be determined based on attributes such as “Energy use”, “GDP”, “Population”, “Urban population growth”, “Urban population”. 

The Project used Weka program for data mining. The attributes selection and classifier algorithms including: 
* Attribute selection algorithms: 
  * Info Gain Attribute Evaluation 
  * Gain Ratio Attribute Evaluation 
  * Correlation Attribute Evaluation  
  * One R Attribute Evaluation  
  * Wrapper Subset Evaluation

* Classifier algorithms: 
  * Naive Bayes
  * Random Trees
  * J48 
  * Decision Table
